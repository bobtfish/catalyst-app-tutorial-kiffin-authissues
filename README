20:12 < krg> in the manual::tutorial::authorization section 'Try Out Authentication And Authorization' getting unauthorized for user test01
20:12 < krg> can someone help me out?

http://localhost:3000/books/url_create/foo/bar/baz

Should work for test01, and give 'Unauthorized' for other users.

Password is mypass

Run script/myapp_server.pl to test the application.
